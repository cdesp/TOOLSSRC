 SSEIO documention TN106

1) Introduction

SSEIO is a Simple Screen  Editor contained in the  disk
controller  ROM  and is configured as device 18. It  is
only  available   under  the  paged  operating  system,
although  it  is  used by the  32K CPM  system.  It  is
faster  than the normal screen editor and  consequently
is not as powerful.

2) Opening SSEIO

The    device   will  ignore   any parameter string  on
OPEN. There is no difference between opening for  input
and  opening    for  output. A 25 lines by  80  columns
screen will  be  created   and cleared. Inputting  from
SSEIO  will   yield  an  error  in  PIOS  (Paged  Input
Output System).

3) Outputting to SSEIO

Non-control     characters     are  displayed  and  the
cursor  advanced.  When  the 80th  character  has  been
written  to  a  line, the cursor remains  on  the  last
character,  and  becomes   a block  cursor.  Subsequent
characters   are   printed    on     the   next   line.
