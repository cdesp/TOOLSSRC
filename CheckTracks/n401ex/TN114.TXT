   ANALOG DEVICE DRIVER TN114

M. Rousselle, NB477 APIO 22: device 22.

The  APIO  device  driver  is   meant  for  measurement
control of physical quantities external to NewBrain, by
directing  output  to  a DAC or routing  input  from  a
multiplexed  8-channel  ADC.    The  driver  uses   Z80
hardware  ports 5 (DAC) and 16 to 19 (only four for the
ADC).

On    OPEN   or  CLOSE,  the  only action taken  is  to
clear   A     and  reg.  pair  BC   before   returning.

OUTPUT   to DAC  merely  reverses the bit-order of  the
byte  in   A (D7 becomes D0 and so on)  before  putting
this byte on  the  Z80 hardware port 5.

INPUT   -  channels 4 to 7  (ADC) and sound (!)  output
are enabled, unless a  portparameter > 3, in which case
the  first   4 channels (0-3) are selected  (these  are
used internally).

-  next, the port  parameter  is decided upon (must  be
in  range 0-3), and the next appropriate hardware  port
16 to  19    is chosen for input.

-    conversion  of  the   analog sample is started  by
sending a NULL control word, and some time is wasted by
a  delay   in  the source code (conversion time  of  50
nano  secs,  as stated by GBS,  seems  very  unlikely);
after  that  delay  a byte is read in from  the  chosen
channel.

REM:

-    the  APIO  device    driver    does  not   disable
interrupts;  as  a consequence samples of fast-changing
voltages,   i.e.   audio  signals,  are   easily   lost

-  for crucial measurements, even refreshing the screen
should   be   avoided  by   disabling   bus   requests:

PUT#7,1         to   disable   PUT#7,0   to   re-enable

of    course,  after  opening  device  7  by  means  of
OPEN#7,7,7.
