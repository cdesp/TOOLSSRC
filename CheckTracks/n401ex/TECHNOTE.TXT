A  List of Technical Notes and  Diagrams

By  October 1982 a set of  12  technical notes has been available free
to dealers and customers. The last technical note to be issued was 18.
There  are  also several technical diagrams on connections to a  range
of printers  and on communications to other computers. The majority of
questions  asked of  the technical support staff were capable of being
answered  by these notes. Orginally the manual was  photo-copied  from
the  hand-book    produced   for    the     Leasco  VBrain.  This  was
corrected  and  improved and in January several thousand  copies  were
printed.  However, only the OEM user could claim to require more  than
the FREE technical notes.

The Technical Notes are:-
 1 VF display character set
 2 NewBrain keyboard codings (UK)
 3 NewBrain keyboard codings (France)
 4 NewBrain printer interface
 5 Memory allocation (un-expanded)
 6 BASIC -general discription
