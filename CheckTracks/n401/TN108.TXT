System page description - TN108

Introduction

This document describes the contents of the system page under the
NewBrain paged memory operating system and also the fixed memory areas
used by the NewBrain in the non-paged operating system.

The system page is a page of RAM which normally resides in Slot 0. It
contains all the data structures necessary to system operation
including:

1. The Status Table.

2. The page Store, ie.e the number of pages currently resident.

3. The Region Table.

4. Access to operating system routines.

5. GETVIDEO.

Notation and nomenclature

OS - non-paged operating system.

POS - paged memory operating system.

Bn - bit number n where 0 is the least significant bit.

P - paged.

NP - non-paged.

MMS - memory management system.

IOS - input/output system (in OS).

PIOS - paged input/output system (in POS).

Object - a memory area allocated by the MMS.

COP - the COP 420 input/output microprocessor.

EIM - Expansion Interface Module

Page - an 8K area of the paged memory highway address space, all of
which is addressible by a single hardware page address.

Page number - a value which is used to access a unique page. This is
a two byte number of which B12-B15 are 0.

Slot - one of the eight 8K areas in the Z80 address space into which a
page may be brought in.

System page - a page which is usually in slot 0 containing
fundamental system information.

Slot n page number - A two byte number where B0-B11 are the page
number and B13-B15 are n. B12 is 0.

Location - the Z80 address which can be used to access an area of
memory when the page it is on has been placed in an appropriate
slot.

Region - a set of contiguous RAM pages used for a similar purpose as
allocated by the page allocator.

Video address - a location within the 32K of video RAM. B15 is
usually 1.

Stretched format - the bytes of a table entry are spaced 256 bytes
apart. The first bytes of consecutive entries are adjacent.

Not used - reserved for future expansion.

PARS

The PARS area exists between locations 0 and FF in both OS and
POS.

The System Parameters are held in the first 256 bytes of Slot Zero
Page (SZP) and in the area of RAM from 500H to 5FFH of the SZP
(MORPARS). The majority of the locations below 100H used in the
unpaged system are also used in the paged system with the same meaning
- in the case of any deviation from this, the locations are noted
below.

0 DI and 1- 3 TPON. NP contains the instructions DI, JP PONINT (an
address in the EF system ROM). P contains DI, JP 0. This is designed
for the use of NewBrains with power-down facility. POS does not
support this facility, and is not supported by the hardware in
models A and AD.

4 - 5 B3PRM. NP is the address of the start of the RAM available to
BASIC and is adjusted by OS as the IO buffer area increases and
decreases. P is available for use by the user program. BASIC sets it

BASIC. P is available for use by the user program. BASIC sets it to
C000H.

520 - 5FF MORPARS. Expansion to PARS area initialised to 0. Unused
(at present).

600 - 6FF STATUSTABLE.

The n'th byte of the table is owned by the device driver and any
associated interrupt handling routine currently connected to stream n,
and is called the "status word" for stream n. It may be peeked by
anything, but only altered by its owners. The status word is set to
zero on system initialisation and whenever its owner is closed, if its
owner supports the status word. (We say that a device "supports the
status word" if it might alter it). The status word for stream n will
have value zero if stream n is not open or if stream n does nor
support the status word or if the value of its bits happen to be zero.
The meaning of the bits are as follows:

bit/mnemonic/meaning if set

0 IEST Input error status: the next call to input from this
stream will produce an error in accordance with the
usual behaviour of the device connected.

1 OEST Output error status: the next call to output to this
stream will produce an error in accordance with the
usual behaviour to the device connected.

2 NRIST Not ready for input: the next call to input from this
stream may result in a long wait, or if the device is
the sort which has returns immediately and has a
conventional return for "no data returned" then this
return will occur.

3 NROST Not ready for input: the next call to input from this
stream may result in a long wait, or a loss of data.


4 EOFST End-of-file: the next input from this stream will
result in a read past end-of-file error.

5, 6, 7 Reserved for expansion.

Note that a meaning is systemically attached to a status word bit
only if the bit is set - the precise interpretation will depend on
the device: for example, an error may still occur on reading even
if IEST is not set. This also means that some devices might only
partially support a status word: for example, unless there are other
compelling reasons it is not necessary to assume that a device
opened for input only, which would produce an error if an attempt were
made to output to it, should keep OEST set. 700 - AFF TABLEZERO. This
is the base table of the MMS data structure, which contains the real
addresses of the secondary tables. See MMS documentation for details.

B00 - CFF STREAMTABLE. The entries are in streched format. An
entry of 0 indicates the stream is not open. Otherwise the entry
contains the object number of the buffer object. The first byte of
this contains the device number, the second contains the port number
and the rest of the object is the own memory area.

D00 - DFF PARAMAREA. This is an area used as workspace by PIOS and
FINDLIBRARY.

E00 - 11FF PDEVTAB. This is the table of device drivers, which is in
streched format. The first two bytes of each entry give the slot 4
page number of the device driver and the second two bytes give its
location.

1200 - 15FF ZPTABLE. This is the table of system routines, which is in
streched format. The first two bytes of each entry give the slot 7
page number of the device driver and the second bytes give its
location.

1600 - 167F VIDTABLE. This gives the video addresses and lengths of
the 32 possible video areas. The first two bytes of each entry
contains the video address and the second two contain the length. All
video areas are multiples of 128 in size.

1680 - 169F ENTRYAVAILABLETABLE. This is a bit map table auxiliary to
MMS. The bits are ordered with B0 of the bytes being for 0 to 31, B1
being for 32 to 63 etc. If a bit is a one it means that the secondary
MMS table it corresponds to exists and has a free entry. See MMS
documentation.

16A0 - 1701 REGIONTABLE. Each region has a six byte entry. The
first two bytes correspond to the first page belonging to the
region. The second two are the slot 4 page number of the region
manager (if the most significant byte is 0 it means there is none),
and the third two are the location of the region manager. The last two
bytes of REGIONTABLE (REGTOP) are a dummy entry to mark the end of
region 16.

1702 - (ESYSPAGE)-1 SLOTZEROCODE. This area contains various important
system routines. If it is required to put in a new one then put it in
at (ESYSPAGE) and increment (ESYSPAGE past it).
