ACIA (Communications) Device Driver TN110

GENERAL

The  Asynchronous    Communications  Interface  Adapter
(ACIA)  is  capable  of providing  a  range  of  serial
communications  options  to  meet a variety  of  needs.
These  may   be  accessed  through  the special  device
drivers  provided  in  the Expansion  Interface  Module
(EIM)   and      Peripheral  Interface  Module   (PIM).

Two  device  drivers are  provided as part of  the  EIM
software to operate the various ACIA channels available
either on the EIM itself (marked LP or SERIAL  PRINTER,
and V24or SERIAL COMMS) or on the Network Modules which
can  be attached to  it  (marked CH0,CH1,..,CH7 on each
Network  Module). Two similar device drivers, with some
facilities  omitted,  are provided as part of  the  PIM
software  to operate the two channels available on that
module  (marked  CH0 and CH1). In each case,  a  simple
RS232C  /  V24  interface is provided running  on  five
wires:  DATAIN,  READY  TO RECEIVE, DATAOUT,  CLEAR  TO
SEND, and GROUND.

The two channels provided on the EIM use the same clock
circuit  and  the  same ACIA, which is  multiplexed  in
order to operate both channels. They must therefore  be
operated  at  the same transmit and receive baud rates.
All the ACIA channels on any one Network Module or  PIM
share the  same clock  circuit, and so must be operated
at   matching   transmit   and  receive   baud   rates.

Up   to   four  Network Modules may be  attached  to  a
NewBrain via the EIM. Each provides an additional eight
communications  channels. The select switch must be set
to  0  on  the  first Network Module, 1 on the next,  2
on  the  third,  and  3  on  the last. Each channel  on
each Network Module is referenced  by its ACIA  number,
which   depends   on  the  setting  of   this   switch:

        CH0  CH1  CH2  CH3
Switch setting
0       A1   A2   A3   A4
1       A9   A10  A11  A12
2       A17  A18  A19  A20
3       A25  A26  A27  A28

        CH4  CH5  CH6  CH7
Switch setting
0       A5   A6   A7   A8
1       A13  A14  A15  A16
2       A21  A22  A23  A24
3       A29  A30  A31  A32

The   device  driver designed   for  printer  operation
contains   the   usual  automatic  NewBrain   features,
including expansion of TABs and insertion of a  newline
at  the end of a line. In addition, these features  can
be  suppressed   or   the   line   length  changed,  as
detailed under  OPEN and OUTPUT below. 

OPEN

Parameters     supplied   on  open  are   as   follows:

1   Device  Number  The  device  number  of  the   ACIA
communications  device   is  17, and that of  the  ACIA
printer device is 16.

2 Port Number No use of this is made by the device.  It
can,  however,  be used to make multiple copies of  the
device, for instance  when  the Network Module is used.

3  Parameter String The parameter string must have  the
following  form:

parameter-string   ::=     [pstring-option]*

pstring-option   ::=transmit-rate-option
        or receive-rate-option
        or length-option
        or buffer-option
        or immediate-return
            -option
        or acia-option
        or data-bits-option
        or stop-bits-option
        or parity-option
        or  protocol-option

transmit-rate-option    ::=      T  75..50000

Sets    transmit  baud  rate.  If receive baud rate  is
over  19200,  then transmit baud rate must be  over   195

receive-rate-option    ::=      R  75..50000

Sets   receive  baud  rate.   If transmit baud rate  is
over  19200, then  receive  baud  rate must be over 195

length-option ::= L 0..255

Sets line length for printer line. L0 suppresses  auto-
features,ie gives "honest" output

buffer-option ::= * 0..32

Sets   buffer  size  in  256-byte  units.  *0   selects
unbuffered mode

immediate-return-option ::= I

Requests   driver  to  return  with  error  instead  of
waiting  for  data to be available or ACIA to be  ready

acia-option ::= A 0..32

A0  is on the Expansion  Module. A1-A8 are on the first
Network Module, etc.

data-bits-option ::= D (7 | 8)

stop-bits-option ::= S (1 | 2)

parity-option ::= P (O | E | Z)

Odd, Even or Zero (no parity)

protocol-option ::= H | F | N

Several  of  the  options interact  with  one  another:

protocol-option   N   is   not   allowed   unless   the
no-buffer-option is selected - ie protocol N cannot run
in buffered mode.

The     parity-option   must   be selected, and must be
O  or   E, when the data-bits-option is set to  7.  The
parity-option  must not be selected, or must be set  to
Z, if the  data-bits-option  is set to 8.

Errors    may    result  on   OPEN  depending  on  what
other streams have already been opened:

On the EIM (ACIA number = 0), if the other ACIA channel
is already in use then the baud rates must be the same,
or   an  error will result. The same error  number  may
also be  given if a stream is open which uses the Sound
or the Analogue device driver, as these make  extensive
use of the EIM clock circuit.

On  any Network Module, once  one ACIA channel has been
opened, an error will result if another ACIA stream  is
opened using different baud rates.

On   the  EIM, if one  channel  is opened  in  buffered
mode,  the other channel may not be opened at all.  (In
early  releases,  this  does  not result  in  an  error
message,  but    its    use    is    not  recommended.)

If   another  stream  is  already open to the  selected
ACIA,  the  open  will fail with an  error.  (On  early
releases, a  weaker check is made: if another stream is
open  to the selected ACIA  in buffered mode ,  then  a
new  stream   cannot  be opened to  the  same  ACIA  in
buffered mode.)

Some  checks are made in the OPEN which depend  on  the
operating environment:

If   an  ACIA  is selected  on  a Network Module  which
is  not connected, or has its select switch set to  the
wrong value, then an error will result (except on early
releases).

When  using  the  PIM  software,  ie  the  EIM  is  not
connected,   the   ACIA  number  must  be   1   or   2.

When    using  the  EIM,  the  default  values  of  the
parameters are

T9600 R9600 L80 *1 A0 D8 S1 PZ H

When  the  Peripheral  Interface Module is used without
the  EIM, the default values are

T9600 R9600 L80 *0 A1 D8 S1 PZ H

INPUT

Both   device  type 16 and 17  may be used  for  input.
Device  type 16, when the ACIA number is 0, will  input
data  from    the    LP  connection  on  the  expansion
interface;  device  type  17  will input from  the  V24
connection.  For   ACIA numbers 1 to 32,  there  is  no
difference  on   INPUT between device types 16 and  17.

1)   Unbuffered mode ("*0"):  The ACIA status  register
is  read  until  either an error state or a  Read  Data
Register Full condition is detected. The RTS line  will
be  pulsed   low   while  this  poll  takes  place  for
protocol-option N,  or   pulsed high for
protocol-option  H.  The routine then returns  with  an
error  number  or  the   data    read  from  the  ACIA.

2)  Buffered mode: The next byte of data is taken  from
the  buffer.   If  any error has  been detected by  the
interrupt  service     routine   since    the  previous
call to INPUT,  it  is reported instead of drawing data
from    the  buffer,  even  though  it  may  have  been
signalled at  a later time than when the next available
byte   of  data   was actually read from the ACIA. When
the buffer becomes  empty, the device driver will  wait
until data is available.

OUTPUT

For   device   type  17,  and  for device type 16  when
the  line length is zero,the data byte entered  to  the
device  driver  is output as below. For device type 16,
with a non-zero line length, newline (0DH) is  expanded
to  newline,  line-feed (0D0AH), tab (09H) is  expanded
to  at  least one space and sufficiently many  to  take
the next   character printed to a multiple of 8 (or, if
this  would take the  printer past the end of a line, a
newline  and   line-feed    are output), and a  newline
and  line-feed  are inserted  at  the end of each line.
The   device  driver  checks  whether  the  next   byte
following  an   inserted line-feed is a line-feed,  and
if  this   is   so    one   line-feed   is  suppressed.

1) Unbuffered mode ("*0"):

The  ACIA status register is read until a Transmit Data
Register  Empty  (TDRE) condition is found.  This  will
occur  when   the  ACIA has begun to transmit the  last
byte  of  data  written  to  it, provided the CTS  line
is then low. Depending on the protocol-option selected,
RTS  may be set low for the duration of this poll; this
is  the  case when option H is selected. The data  byte
entered  to  OUTPUT  is then written to the  ACIA  data
register.

2) Buffered Mode:

The  data  is entered  into  the associated buffer  and
the  device driver returns. If the buffer is full,  the
routine waits  until there is room to insert the  byte.

CLOSE

If   the  stream was  opened  for buffered output,  and
data  is  still in the buffer for output,  the  routine
will  wait  for    the  buffer  to  be  emptied  before
completing  the close. The  user may press the STOP key
to   force  an  immediate  close  when  this   happens.

Effect  of  selecting  immediate return

In  the INPUT routine, instead of waiting for the  ACIA
to become ready or for the buffer to contain data,  the
device driver will return with error 208. In the OUTPUT
routine,  instead   of waiting for the ACIA  to  become
ready or for room in the buffer, the device driver will
return with error 210. In the CLOSE routine, instead of
waiting for the buffer to empty, the routine will close
down   the   buffer immediately, but no  error  message
will be given.

Summary of errors

The   ACIA  device  drivers   are liable to return  the
following errors:

Error 109 Attempt was made to read following OPEN  OUT#

connected

EXAMPLES

1 Using a printer

To open a 2400 baud printer:

OPEN OUT#16,16,"T2400"

If   possible,  the printer should be set up to run  at
9600  baud,  as this is the default baud rate,  so  one
need enter only

OPEN OUT#16,16

and   in  any case it is  best  to run the  printer  as
fast as possible.

Now    ensure  the   printer   is connected to  the  LP
connection on the EIM, and switch it on.

To   list   a  program  to  the  printer,  then   enter

LIST #16

or

LIST #16,100 - 300

to list lines 100 to 300.

To print data, enter

PRINT    #16,"NewBrain    expansion    LP    interface"

PRINT #16,2+3,a$(4),p1

etc.   The syntax is the same  as PRINT to the  screen,
but  the  TAB  function is equivalent to  a  comma  (,)
separator regardless of the TAB value. In each case,  a
single TAB control  (character 9) is issued by BASIC to
the  device driver, which then issues enough spaces  to
advance  the  printer to the start of the  next  print-
zone. The zone width  is eight columns.

2 Line length

The  printer  device driver may be used with  wider  or
narrower paper  than  the default  of  80 columns.  The
user  may then  set the number of printable  charactets
that can  be  output before a newline and line-feed are
inserted by using a length-option in the OPEN parameter
string:

OPEN   #16,16,"L120"   :REM   line   length   is    120

OPEN #16,16,"L60" :REM line length is 60

Note   that  specifying  a  line length for device type
17   does  not  result in a syntax error;  however,  no
significance  is  then  attached to  the  line  length.

3 Control codes

Control  codes can be sent to the printer using  device
16 by means of a simple PUT from BASIC:

PUT #16,12 :REM form feed

PUT #16,27,30 :REM an escape sequence

PUT#16,3,12,18,56,84,56,144,96,3    :REM   a    control
sequence

However,  care  must then be taken to ensure  that  the
device  driver  does not insert extra codes in  such  a
sequence due to the  auto matic insertion and expansion
features.   At   times when it  is important to  output
codes to the printer without having automatic insertion
and  expansion   applied  to  newlines  and  TABs,  for
example  when  a graphics  printer is used, the  stream
may be opened with a line length of zero:

OPEN #16,16,"L0"

The   stream  will then perform in the same  way  as  a
stream opened using device type 17. The only difference
will  be that the  LP connection on the EIM is used. If
this  is done,  however,  the user becomes  responsible
for  providing  all necessary  control codes,  such  as
line feed  after newline, directly:

PRINT #16,a$: PUT #16,10

4 Buffered communication

By  default, a stream  operating through device type 16
or   17  uses  a buffer of  256  characters,  including
expanded  TABs   and automatically inserted line  feeds
and  newline   codes.  The size of this buffer  can  be
specified  as  a  multiple of  256 when the  stream  is
opened:

OPEN    OUT#16,16   :REM   buffer    5120    characters

OPEN  #17,17,"*4" :REM buffer 1024 characters each  way

Opening a stream using OPEN OUT# means that it is  then
only  available  for output. This  form of OPEN  should
always be adopted when using device 16 or 17 to operate
a  printer.  If OPEN  IN# is used, then the  stream  is
opened  for two-way communication, and two  independent
buffers are created, one for input and one for  output.

5 Unbuffered communication

The   OPEN  parameter   string  may  specify  a  buffer
length of zero:

OPEN  OUT#16,16,"*0"  :REM  unbuffered  printer  output

OPEN  #17,17,"*0" :REM unbuffered input-output  on  V24

to    avoid   the   automatic   buffering.   Unbuffered
communication  must be  specified when both  device  16
and device 17 are to be open on the EIM simultaneously,
also  when using the NewBrain to NewBrain protocol,  eg

OPEN#17,17,"N*0"

6 Network Module

To  open an input  communications stream on CH7 of  the
first  Network Module (ie select switch set to 0) using
default options:

OPEN #8,17,8,"A8"

To  open a bi-directional communications stream on  CH0
of  the     first   Network   Module, communicating  at
4800  baud  with an unexpanded NewBrain  in  unbuffered
mode:n

OPEN #1,17,1,"A1T4800R4800N*0"

To  open  an output printer stream on CH2 of the  third
Network  Module  running  at  9600  baud  with  a  1024
character buffer:

OPEN OUT#27,16,27,"A27*8"

In  each of these examples,  the stream number has been
chosen  to be the same as the ACIA number, to  make  it
easier to  remember later which stream is being used on
which   channel.  The   port number which precedes  the
parameter  string in the OPEN has been chosen to  match
the  stream number to make sure that each device  type,
port number  pair will be unique.
