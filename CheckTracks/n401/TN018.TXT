Production   of   User   Defined Characters

(Non-paged NewBrains)

This  method will allow the production of user  defined
characters  in the high resolution graphics area of the
screen.  (Note  the  term  "high  resolution  graphics"
includes  the  40 column screen,  which  many  NewBrain
users  refer to Low resolution. Normally LO-RES  refers
to block graphics character.)

1. Layout of the Character ROM.

Each  character  occupies a 8 x 10 bit pattern  on  the
screen. This is compressed into an 8 x 8 pattern in the
ROM.

Characters  are represented by 8 sets of 256 bytes. The
lowest  byte representing the top row of  character  0,
the next, the top row of character 1, etc.. Bit 0 has a
special meaning in each case and may not be used except
as  described  below. The character is  represented  by
bits 1 to 7.


Character are decoded as follows:

Characters 0-31 and characters 128-159: rows 7, 8 and 9
are identical. The system generates 8 and 9 by  copying
row 7.

Other  characters: rows 2-7 are represented as  stored.
Bit 0 of rows 0 and 1 are inspected. If bit 0 is 0  the
row  is  plotted as stored. In such a case  the  stored
position is left blank. Note that setting bit 0 of  row
1  to  1  and  bit  0  of  row  0  to  0  will  produce
discontinuous   character.  Bit  0  is  not  displayed.


Examples

Row Displayed  Stored   Dec.

0   -xxxxxx-  01111110  126
1   -x----x-  01000010   66
2   -x----x-  01000010   66
3   -x----x-  01000010   66
4   -xxxxxx-  01111110  126
5   --------  00000000    0
6   --------  00000000    0
7   --------  00000000    0
8   --------
9   --------

0   --------  01000011   67*
1   --------  01111111  127*
2   --------  00000000    0
3   --------  00000000    0
4   --------  00000000    0
5   -xxxxxx-  01111110  126
6   -x----x-  01000010   66
7   -x----x-  01000010   66
8   -x----x-
9   -xxxxxx-


*  These lines are displayed as 8 and  9  respectively.


2. User Defined Characters.

Bytes   77H  and 78H (119  &  120) hold the address  of
the  the  first  byte  of  the  default  character  set
(character  set  2).  To  find  the  address  use   the
following:

a=PEEK(119)+256*PEEK(120)

The   character  set  occupies  256 x 8  (2048)  bytes.

If  the user wishes to define  a totally new  character
set he should reserve 2048 bytes and change the address
at  77H  and 78H to point to the lowest address of this
block   (TOP).  Values  may  then  be  POKEd  into  the
reserved area to produce the desired characters. If the
user  wishes to change_some_characters only it is  best
to  copy   the default character set from ROM into  the
reserved  area and then to change only those which  are
required.

The   following program will copy the default character
set and change the page zero pointer.

10 RESERVE 2028:a=TOP:b=PEEK(119)+256*PEEK(120)
20 FOR l=1 TO 2048
30 z=PEEK(b+i-1): POKE a+i,z
40 NEXT i
50 c=INT(a+1)/256:d=a+2-(c*256)
60 POKE 119,d :POKE 120,c
70 END

In     high  resolution  graphics  the  character   set
addressed  will  now  be the copy in RAM. This  may  be
changed by the user as required.
