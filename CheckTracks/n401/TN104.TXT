CONFIGURE  program    documentation

issue 1.1 Technical Note 104


1) Introduction

The   NewBrain  CP/M   CONFIGURE program which will run under both 32K
and  64K  CP/M   systems,  allows  the user to  set  his  CP/M  system
according to the type of disk drives and devices he wishes to use. The
information is processed and written to the first sector of the  first
track  of  the drive specified  at  the end. This information is  thus
copied during SYSGEN  and  does not affect the files on the disk.  The
information is  only read in at cold boot time, so will not take force
until   that  occurs.  When  a cold  boot  occurs,  the  configuration
information is read off the disk in physical drive 0 (usually A:). The
information  on  diskettes  in    any  other  drive  is  ignored.  The
configuration  information   is used in both CP/M systems and in  both
the paged  and  non-paged DISCIO systems (under the NewBrain operating
system).

NB:     This    is  the  first  of    four  programs  developed.  SAVE
CONfiguration  and      RESTore CONfiguration where  written  to  help
users  set up a library  of configurations. CONFIG.BAS was written  to
allow the CS*  files to be edited without running through the sequence
outlined  below. One program ought to have been written to  allow  the
creation,  editing and restoration of configure files. Still, this  is
what we have  and have to live with it.

2) Starting up

From  the  CP/M prompt (A>)  enter CONFIGUR and  press  newline.  When
running  the program the user may abandon the program, at any point by
typing cntrl/C, and no change will be made. When answering a  question
the  CP/M line editor can be used to correct answers. Once newline has
been  pressed   it  is  not possible to correct any errors.  The  XSUB
utility may   prove useful.

3) Configuring the disks

3.1) How many disk drives do you wish to configure

Enter  the number of disk  drives there are in your system. This  will
usually be a maximum of  4, but may be more if you have a hard disk or
have  a   RAM  disk facility. If you specify more than there  are  the
floppy  disk  controller will not object, but there will be a  strange
delay  of a few seconds on cold booting while the controller  attempts
to recalibrate    the    unattached drives. (Note the CP/M master from
GBS  was supplied set up for twin drives, hence the advise to  RESTCON
cs40  or  cs80 for  owners of single drive systems.) From now  on  the
questions will  be asked for each drive.

3.2)  What is the physical drive number (Usually n)

This   gives  the   hardware  drive number to be used  to  access  the
drives.  Usually   you   should respond with the suggested value,  but
if  you  have  hard disks or RAM disk facilitys they may be different.

3.3)  What  is  the  gap  length (usually 42)

You    should   always   enter     42   unless  you  have  other  disk
controllers.

3.4)  What is the gap length  on formatting

You    should  always  enter   40 unless you have strange disk drives.

3.5)  What  is  the special parameter byte of the  drive  (usually  0)

This   will   be 0 usually  though setting certain bits  have  certain
interesting  effects.  Setting bit 0 will cause data to  be  read  and
written  to the disk in inverted format. This can be used for  example
when  reading many SuperBrain disk formats. Setting bit 1  will  cause
the  disk   contoller   to  double  the track number  when  seeking  a
certain track   (though    the cylinder number in the sector  searched
for will remain unchanged). This can be useful for reading a 48 tracks
per  inch  (TPI)  formatted  disk  with a 96  TPI  drive.  It  is  not
recommended to write to a disk in this  mode as it may not be read  by
a 48 TPI drive reliably.

3.6)     What  is  the  seek  rate    for  the  disk  in  milliseconds

Consult the technical manual for the drive you are using and enter  in
the  correct value.  If in doubt 32 is safe but slow. If the drive has
been supplied  by Grundy Business Systems the value you require should
be  supplied. The 48TPI single sided drives were set up at  20ms,  and
the  96TPI  double  sided drives at 4ms. Usually  48TPI  double  sided
drives require 20ms.

3.7)  What  is the  sector  size (512 or 1024)

The  disk controller supports two sizes of physical sector  size,  512
and  1024.  However   the software will only support a 512 byte sector
unless  an  expansion box is used. Usually a 512 byte sector  will  be
used.  (For   this reason Osborne 100K diskettes can not be  read,  as
they require 256byte sectors, ditto IBM).

3.8) How many sectors are  there per track

This   question  refers  to  the number of physical sectors (NOT  CP/M
sectors)  there   are   per track. If 5.25 inch disks are  being  used
there  is  a  maximum of 10 (which is the usual value)  for  512  byte
sectors and 5  for 1024 byte sectors.

3.9)  What  is the  skew  factor (usually 0)

Normally you will enter 0.  This is because when you format a disk the
controller  will  hard-format  the most optimum skew factor  onto  the
disk.  However   you may wish to  use  a software skew to  read  other
formats  of  disk.  For  example, many SuperBrain formats use  a  skew
factor  of   2.  The   skew factor is one greater than the  number  of
physical  sectors  skipped between reading sectors on a track  in  the
logically correct order.

3.10)  How  many sides does  the drive have (1 or 2)

Enter  1 for single sided  drives and 2 for double-sided  drives.  You
may  of course enter 1 for  a double-sided drive if you wish to read a
single  sided  disk  in it. If you answer 2 you will  then  be  asked:

3.10.1) Are the tracks  numbered .....

If  you have a double-sided drive you can either use the tracks on one
side of the disk followed by the tracks on the other side, or you  can
use  first a track on one side, then a track on the other. If you wish
to  use  the   former  then reply 1, if  the  latter  (which  is  more
efficient  and  is the usual NewBrain format) then reply 2. Many alien
formats (e.g. SuperBrain) do however use the former scheme, or confuse
everyone   and  use  both.  If  you have  48TPI  double  sided  drives
compatability with single  sided drives can be maintained by answering
1.

3.11)     How   many  tracks  per    side  are  there  on   the   disk

To   answer  this  question  you should refer to the technical  manual
of  the disk drive. For a 5.25 inch drive normally it will be 40 for a
48  TPI drive and  80 for a 96 TPI drive. (Note certain diskettes  are
not capable   of  working  to  40/80 track, and therefore care must be
taken   to   use   only  those  that  state  40  track/   80   track.)

3.12) How many track are reserved (Usually 2)

The   usual answer will be 2. The system information in  the  NewBrain
system  tracks  take  up 7K bytes, and the reserved tracks  should  be
enough to hold this.

3.17)    What  is  the  blocksize    in  Kbytes  ([1,]2,4,8,  or   16)

Usually  it will be 2 for 48  TPI single/double sided drives and 4 for
96  TPI  double sided drives. Other format diskettes  may  have  other
blocksizes.  If introducing a wierd format a rule of thumb is to use a
blocksize that  will give you between 128 and 255 blocks. The  maximum
number  of  blocks  is 512. Once you have answered this  question  the
program  will tell you the  disk capacity. This may be less  than  the
advertised  capacity for  two reasons. Firstly it does not include the
space for the system tracks and secondly it will be a multiple of  the
blocksize  and  any  odd  amount is unused. This  will  be  the  value
displayed when doing a STAT DSK:.

3.18)  How  many entries are there in the directory  (multiple  of  n)

Usually   this  will be the lowest number possible. If it  is  greater
than  128  then a message will be output which states  that  only  128
entries will be checked. This means that the CP/M system will only sum
check  the  first  128 directory entries in its system  which  detects
whether   the     disks     have     been   changed   surreptitiously.

3.19)  Is  the  disk   removable (1=yes, 2=no)

Usually   answer   1,  but   for non-removable hard disks and RAM disk
facilities  it may be  more efficient to answer 0. If you answer 0 the
CP/M  system   will not use its directory sumcheck  system  to  detect
whether the disks have been changed.

4) Configuring devices

This  information is only used in the 64K CP/M system, to describe the
devices  that are attached to the CP/M logical devices (IOBYTE is  not
used). Stream 0 refers to the keyboard, stream 1 refers to the screen,
stream  2 refers  to the printer, stream 3 refers to the reader/punch,
and stream  4 is for keyboard status.

You    should    respond  as    follows  (null  means  just  newline):

Stream 0 - 19 (may be 6 on  some
            prototypes), 0, null
Stream 1 - 18, 0, null
Stream 2 - 16, 0, *0L0
Stream 3 - 17, 0, *0n
Stream 4 - 3, 0,  16

5)   Finishing  at  the end it will ask you which drive you  wish  the
configuration information to  be written to. This is your last  chance
to  press  cntrl/C.   If   A  then  reply 0, if  B  then  1  etc.  The
information  will  then  be written to the disk and the  program  will
finish.

CSP 13/4/83  : GFG 2/5/84

NB   due   to the  liquidation  of stock more than one version of  the
serial and centronics device drivers have been sold. None of them work
correctly  in   all manners.

Device   16 baud  rate  parameter does not work. I have been  told  by
one  source   that   using    a buffer of 1 solves  this.,  ie  *1l80.

 Configuration Parameters for NewBrain diskettes and to Read
Foreign Disk Formats                issue 1.1

Parameters for Configuration

Notation   8080   means twin 80 track system. 80408  means  80   track
drive  A, and a 40 track diskette read on an 80 track drive B.  TU  is
Tuscan  format.   35 implies SuperBrain. D stands  for   double  sided
48TPI.  Files type cs* where c stands for configure  and  s for serial
streams  devices   16  and  17.  cc   therefore   means  configuration
centronics.
